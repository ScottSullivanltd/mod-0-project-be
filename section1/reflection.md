## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
 - I am comfortable asking questions in general.  I admit I do like trying to figure out a problem on my own but I also know when I am stuck and need help.  I also understand that while I do have some experience with programming, I am still very green and don't need to prove anything to anyone other than the fact that I am willing to admit I don't know something and if I ask I will typically get an answer from either a classmate or an instructor.  I probably tend to wait too long but also find that a question I may have is likely to be a question other students have and usually it gets asked before I get to it.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
 - `p "Hello World!"`

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
 - The hashtag '#' is used to indicate a comment in a ruby file.

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
 - An integer is a whole number including zero. A float is a number that includes a decimal.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
 - `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
 - `p animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
 - Interpolation is a string method that allows you to stick data into the middle of a string.
 - `p "When I go to the zoo, one of my favorite animals to see is the #{animal}."`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
 - The `gets.chomp` method is used to get input from a user.

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
 - One common string method is the `.length` method. This method returns the number of characters in a string including spaces.
 - Another common string method is the `.split` method.  This method breaks a string into parts and returns the parts in an Array.  It will break a sentence into words and cut the string wherever it encounters a space character.
