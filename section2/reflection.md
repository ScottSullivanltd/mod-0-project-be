## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
 - A point from the article that was new to me was the concept of setting S.M.A.R.T. goals and what the acronym SMART stands for: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound. This is really helpful as a way to set and keep goals in life as well as in programming.  For programming it makes sense to set smaller goals within a large project to break it into parts.  Taking a large coding project and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable, sub goals.  This approach will really help me going forward when faced with seemingly insurmountable large projects.
 - A point that resonates with me is that experience and practice are essential for growth and success - in life as well as with programming.  Practice, practice, practice.  Don't give up. Mistakes are an essential part to learning.  These points are part of an approach that I have always tried to follow and have helped me learn and overcome challenges.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
 - I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset by being willing to practice as often as possible.  By accepting that mistakes are a part of learning and making mistakes does not mean I am dumb or unable to understand the material.  Asking questions and doing research are helpful tools when faced with a mistake or a 'road block'.  I think its also important to know that you can learn from other people mistakes as well - especially when working in a group.  And, having patience while learning new material.  Patience, persistence, and practice are keys to a healthy Growth Mindset.
 - Ways I do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset is sometimes being too stubborn when faced with trouble.  I may spend too much time trying to figure out a solution to a problem when I am stuck instead of asking for help sooner.  I tend to feel that I can figure out problems on my own when I could get a solution sooner and without as much aggravation if I simply admit I am stuck and ask for help.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
 - Conditional statements evaluate statements to `true` or `false`.  Most common conditional statements involve equals `==`, greater than `>`, greater than or equal to `>=`, less than `<`, and less than or equal to `<=`.
  * 1 >= 2 ; false
  * (3 * 6) <= (2 * 9) ; true
  * green == (blue + yellow) ; true

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
 - You might want to use an if-statement when you want a program that can make decisions based on certain data or specific criteria.  'If a condition is true then do this thing, if it is false then do another thing or don't do anything'.  Let the program run or not based on the information it is given or inputted by a user.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
 - Ruby syntax is 'if, elsif, else, end'.  The 'if' initiates the code block and set the conditions, you can have as many 'elsif's you want or need, the 'else' gives the statement an "out" in case no other conditions are met, and the 'end' closes the if-statement code block.

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
 - You add multiple conditions to an if statement by using `elsif`.  You can also add multiple conditions to a single line of an if statement by using the 'logical and' which is a double ampersand `&&`, or by using the 'logical or' which is with double pipe `||`.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
 - Ex: num_goldfish = 9

       if num_goldfish > 10
         puts "I have too many goldfish."
       elsif num_goldfish == 10
         puts "I have the right amount of goldfish."
       else
         puts "I need more goldfish."
       end
